# python-challenge

This repository contains my solution of the Python Homwork Assignment: Py Me Up, Charlie. I created 2 Python scripts: [PyBank](https://github.com/NazihZaz/python-challenge/blob/main/PyBank/PyBank%20main.py) and [PyPoll](https://github.com/NazihZaz/python-challenge/blob/main/PyPoll/PyPoll%20main.py).

# PyBank

[PyBank Python Script](https://github.com/NazihZaz/python-challenge/blob/main/PyBank/PyBank%20main.py) analyses the financial records of a company using a set of financial data called [budget_data.csv](https://github.com/NazihZaz/python-challenge/blob/main/PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv), calculates the elements listed below and print them into the [PyBank Analysis](https://github.com/NazihZaz/python-challenge/blob/main/PyBank/Analysis/PyBank%20Analysis.txt). The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. 

- The total number of months included in the dataset.
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes.
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

# PyPoll

[Pypoll Python script](https://github.com/NazihZaz/python-challenge/blob/main/PyPoll/PyPoll%20main.py) analyses a set of poll data called [election_data.csv](https://github.com/NazihZaz/python-challenge/blob/main/PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv), calculates the elements listed below and print them into the [PyPoll Analysis](https://github.com/NazihZaz/python-challenge/blob/main/PyPoll/Analysis/PyPoll%20Analysis.txt) file. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. 

- The total number of votes cast.
- A complete list of candidates who received votes.
- The percentage of votes each candidate won.
- The total number of votes each candidate won.
- The winner of the election based on popular vote.
