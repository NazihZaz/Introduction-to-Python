This repository contains my solution for the Python Homwork Assignment: Py Me Up, Charlie. I created 2 Python script PyBank and PyPoll.

PyBank Python script analyses the financial records of a company using a set of financial data called budget_data.csv, calculates the elements listed below and print them into the Analysis.txt file. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. 

- The total number of months included in the dataset.
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes.
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

Here is the link to the budget_data.csv file:

Pypoll Python script analyses of a set of poll data using a called election_data.csv, calculates the elements listed below and print them into the Analysis.txt file. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. 

- The total number of votes cast.
- A complete list of candidates who received votes.
- The percentage of votes each candidate won.
- The total number of votes each candidate won.
- The winner of the election based on popular vote.
